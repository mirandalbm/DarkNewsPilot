# DarkNews Autopilot System

## Overview

DarkNews Autopilot is a fully automated content creation system that generates, produces, and publishes dark mystery-style news videos across multiple languages and YouTube channels. The system operates with minimal human supervision, automatically sourcing breaking news, creating compelling scripts in a dark documentary style, generating AI avatars with voice synthesis, and publishing to multiple language-specific channels.

The platform features a comprehensive dashboard for monitoring production pipelines, managing content approval workflows, and tracking analytics across all channels. Built as a modern full-stack web application, it combines real-time news aggregation, AI-powered content generation, multi-language dubbing, and automated social media publishing into a single cohesive system.
